# Tensorflow-playground-Neural-Network
TensorFlow Playground is an interactive tool that allows users to visualize and experiment with neural networks in real time.It's a browser-based interface where you can build simple neural networks, adjust parameters like the number of hidden layers, neurons, and activation functions, and see how these changes affect model performance.
